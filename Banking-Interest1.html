        /* Consider the following problem statement:
        A person invests $1000.00 in a savings account 
        yielding 5 percent fixed annual interest. Assuming that all 
        interest is left on deposit in the account, 
        calculate and print the amount of money in the 
        account at the end of each year for 10 years. 
        Use the following formula for determining 
        these amounts:
        
            a = p (1 + r)^n
        
        Where
            p is the present amount invested (i.e., the principal)
            r is the annual rate,
            n is the number of years, and
            a is the amount (future value) on deposit at the end of the nth year         
            */
        // we know: principle: $1000.00, rate = 5%, and number of year: 10  
        // we need to caculate the Future amount of investement

        // decalre variables
        let principal; // present amount to be invested
        const INTEREST_RATE = 0.05; // annual interest rate
        const NUMBER_OF_YEARS = 10;

        let amount; // Future amount of investement

        // initialize varaibles
        principal = 1000.00;

         // processing and output
         // for (let initial_value; condition; increment) {} 
         for (let year = 1; year <= NUMBER_OF_YEARS; year++) {
             // using the Math.pow() method
             amount = principal * Math.pow( (1.0 + INTEREST_RATE), year);
             document.writeln(year + ' -----> ' + amount.toFixed(2) );
             document.writeln('<br />');
         } // end of for loop
